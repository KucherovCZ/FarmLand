
-------------------- WORKING ----------------- // when finished working on task move to DONE

-------------------- TODO -------------------- // when this list is empty release new version

////////// sorted by priority

- Make AdController.cs, connect it to AFK doubling, maybe ad some rewarding for other time. Also connect adViewed event to achievements

- Music, building placement sounds, other sfx - Some SoundController able to control all sounds and music

- Options menu - Audio - music and sfx separately, credits
				 report bug, maybe Localization (Language), documentation/gamepedia, relaunchable tutorial
			   - Stuff not yet developed add as greyed out buttons with message "coming soon"

- Sell button animation (maybe particle-like flying money from the button)

--- LONG TERM GOALS
- Add more crops

-------------------- BUGS -------------------- // this should be empty all the time

--- HIGH PRIORITY

--- LOW PRIORITY

- Replaying tutorial breaks achievements

- !!! COULDNT REPRODUCE - When building lot of buildings (cca 20-30 and more) price is 1999 instead of 2000 (1 lower) IDK why probably caused by float or power system

- Crops are little janky when loading, cant properly trust them so keep an eye on them

-------------------- DONE -------------------- // delete with release of new version

NEW FEATURES

BUGFIXES

----------------------------------------------





Can be added after release

- Try to redraw UI to pixelart style

- redraw all sprites to 128x128 (double the resolution)

- Add more crop sprites for animation (at least 5 for 30s+, for shorter 3 is enough)

- Start menu cinematic zooms (instead of moving, slooowly zoom in and then continue moving, zoom cooldown at least 3 moves)

- Something like documentation/gamepedia (ingame wiki site) with information about all blocks, rates, tutorials and game mechanics

- Add option to remove forest (for AD or long wait)

- StartApp animace (logo)

- Cloud saving (using free cloud unity/google or home server)

- When hovering mouse (holding touch) over button, it will show text defining the block (add 10th item to buttonInfo.txt)

- Notifications?

- Visualisation of barn, city and water range when building (when in placeList)
	-> check when startPlacing for type B || C || W if true show corresponding overlay and update it with each new building
	   use new tilemap with new overlay values (problem with conflicts, multiple city effects on one tile will not work)

- Some building and crop animations https://youtu.be/65IrtBEZeVs (animation speed: 1 = 1 frame/s | 0.5 = 0.5 frame/s === speed is FPS)

- Coast tiles with 45° angle, the corners look weird sometimes

- Animal tiles (with animation of walking), special buildings for collecting animals? (water+food)
